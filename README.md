# glassdoor [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/fschrofner/glassdoor.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/fschrofner/glassdoor)  
*Please note that this framework is still work in progress and might not be usable at all at the moment!*  

glassdoor is a modern, autonomous security framework for Android APKs written in [Scala](http://scala-lang.org/).  
Its purpose is to automatically find backdoors, security flaws and other data leakages in applications running on the Android system, without having any actual access to the code itself.

It uses a simple commandline interface like depicted above. Each command is realized as plugin, which defines dependencies and values it changes in order to support multithreading. The `complete` command basically uses all available plugins.  

## Dependencies  
### Build Dependencies  
Scala

### Runtime Dependencies  
Java  
Grep  
Git  
John The Ripper  
the_silver_searcher [optional]  
Android SDK (including adb & aapt)  
SQLite

## Build Instructions  
Glassdoor uses the wonderful [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) build system to realise its builds.  
In order to build glassdoor yourself, it should be sufficient to open a terminal window in the root directory and call `./gradlew build` there. You will find a ready-to-use version of glassdoor, compressed as tar and zip file, inside `build/distributions` after the build process. Just take either one, extract it and call `bin/glassdoor`.  
If you want to run glassdoor directly (for development purposes, for example) just call `./gradlew run` in the root directory.  
Here you go, your self-compiled version of glassdoor is up and running (hopefully)!

### IntelliJ IDEA  
To start hacking and slashing on glassdoor yourself using the terrific [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/), you need to take further steps.  
First you should install the Scala plugin for IntelliJ. After that you can generate the project files needed by issuing `./gradlew idea` in the root directory.
The next step is to import the project into IntelliJ, by selecting "File" > "Open". Just select the outermost folder (yeah you want all modules to be checked).
It should load the project correctly; now to simplify development you should setup the run configuration. To do so, select "Edit Configurations" next to the run button.
Add a new Gradle configuration, select the outermost glassdoor Gradle project and use the task "run" (without quotes). Give your configuration a name and click "OK".
Then select your newly created configuration from the dropdown menu next to the run button. You should now be able to run and debug glassdoor using IntelliJ.
